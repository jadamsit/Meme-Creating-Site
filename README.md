# node

This was a project that I created using node.js and MySQL. It is a meme creating and sharing social networking site. 
I also created a few python scripts to back up the database and the images

Some of it's functionalities include:

Authentication using Google Account
Display of all memes created
Approval process of memes by administrator
"Like" feature to show who likes what memes
Webhooks to show memes to all users signed in when a new one is created
Creation of Meme applying text and filters using C#
Filter memes by who created them
